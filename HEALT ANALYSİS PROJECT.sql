---Descriptive Statistics
---Goal: Understand general patterns.

---Key Questions:
---How many appointments were No-Shows vs. Shows?

-- No-show counts

 select 
 no_show,
 count(*) as count
 FROM medical_appointments
 GROUP BY no_show;
 
---***'No'	The patient showed up
--  'Yes'	The patient did not show up (a "no-show")

--- Gender distribution

select 
 gender,
 count(*) as count
 FROM medical_appointments
 GROUP BY gender;


----üìå Time Analysis
--- Goal: Examine how scheduling time affects attendance.
--- To analyze how scheduling time affects attendance,
--- I'll examine the waiting time between when a patient schedules the appointment 
--- and the actual appointment date. 
--- Longer waiting times might increase no-shows.

SELECT 
    no_show,
    ROUND(AVG(EXTRACT(DAY FROM appointment_day - scheduled_day)), 2) AS avg_waiting_days,
    COUNT(*) AS total_appointments
FROM medical_appointments
WHERE appointment_day >= scheduled_day
GROUP BY no_show;

--no_show	Meaning
--'No'	The patient showed up
--'Yes'	The patient did not show up (a "no-show")

-- Which days of the week have more no-shows?

-- Weekday effect

select
extract(dow from appointment_day) as weekday,
no_show,
count(*) as count
FROM medical_appointments
group by 1,2
order by weekday;

 ---Which day of the week has the highest no-show rates?

select
to_char(appointment_day,'day') as weekday,
count(*) as total_appointments
FROM medical_appointments
group by 1
order by total_appointments desc;

--**Influence of Patient Characteristics

--Goal: How do health conditions and demographics impact appointment attendance?

--We'll look at:

--Gender

--Age Groups

--Medical Conditions: Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Scholarship (social program), and SMS reminders
